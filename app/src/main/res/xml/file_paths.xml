  Broad path scope required: this is a file manager that opens/shares files
  from anywhere on external storage. The FileProvider is NOT exported
  (android:exported="false") and URIs are granted via FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION
  on a per-file basis, so no blanket access is leaked to other apps.
